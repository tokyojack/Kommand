# Kommand
A extreamly easy way to manage your plugin's commands. Also, you don't need to register your commands within a plugin.yml!

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Copy and paste the util classes from ```src/me/tokyojack/bukkit``` to your project. (Make sure you create a new package)
2. Make sure the util classes have correct package names, class name, and you should be good to go!

TO USE:

Look at the example in the /test/ folder. Make sure you've registered the commands in the onEnable! (Test.java)

Now you've just install the program! You're a pretty cool person:
1. ```(•_•)```
2. ```( •_•)>⌐■-■```
3. ```(⌐■_■)```
